Usage of static Random Nr's
---------------------------
In order to present the question-ordering and shown answers randomly, but having a stable bahavior, we are using static-pseudo-random-numbers.

### Pseudocode selecting next Question
	Answerd allready max Numbers? -> end
	Take a Random Question
		--> Answerd this? --> Take Next Question
		--> Ask this 

### Pseudocode selecting Answers
	count_answers = min(Answers.count, max_answers_count)
	count_answers.times do |counter|
		addAnswer(nexr random) if not in
		if last had a correct?
		if last had a wrong? 
	endÂ©
